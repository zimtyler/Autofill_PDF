    "With the help of script generously shared online by [Andrew Krcatovich]( https://akdux.com/python/2020/10/31/python-fill-pdf-files.htmlFilling-a-PDF ) and [Vivsvaan Sharma]( https://medium.com/@vivsvaan/filling-editable-pdf-in-python-76712c3ce99 ), I was able to write a script that autofilled pdfs with a template pdf and a csv file of client information.\n",

    "Initially, I set my sights too low. In a previous Medium article I posted, I simply manipulated the table with SQL so that I could link the attributes to the appropriate fields in JotForm. While it worked, I had to create a new Jotform document every time I wanted to fill in a new set of forms.\n",

    "With this, I can take a new form and generate over a thousand filled documents in under a minute.\n",

    "2. Creates a nested dictionary with outer dictionary key referencing the client_df row index\n",
    "   a. inner dictionary items are column name, value the client information\n",
    "3. Opens a template pdf (make sure path is set for the pdf used as a template)\n",
    "4. Iterates through the index to select inner dictionary\n",
    "5. For every column name key that is identical to field key (text fillable annotation) in the template, the value is filled in that key.\n",
